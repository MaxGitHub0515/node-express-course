###  To Be Implemented:
- **`Auth`**:
    - **User**  
    - **Admin Dashboard**  

#### Auth Details:
Auth has options of signing in or signing up with **Google & GitHub**, apart from doing it manually.  
For that, I used `Firebase`.  

**Admin can:**  
- Add new books  
- Delete created books  
- Edit book details (e.g., description, title, etc.)  
- See all available books  
- View charts like revenue, etc.  

**User can:**  
- View products and their details  
- Add a product to the cart / Remove a product from the cart  
- Proceed to checkout or continue shopping  
- Fill in the form with personal information  
- Pay for the product and delivery (Total Price)  

---

- **`Cookies`**:  
  Cookies allow users to easily close/open a new tab while keeping credentials valid if referring to the same URL recently used.  

- **`Payment Method`**:  
  Using **Stripe** & **PayPal**  


## Setting up [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)
**With Vite**
``` shell
  npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```
**Create a vite.config.js file and add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to it**
```shell
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```
**Add an @import to your CSS file**
```shell
@import "tailwindcss";
```
**Run your build process**
```shell
npm run dev
```
**Add Tailwind to your HTML**
```shell
<link href="/src/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```



## Setting up [React/Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
**Installing Redux Toolkit**
``` shell
  npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```
**Adding react-redux bindings for use with React**
```shell
 npm install react-redux
```
**Create a Redux Store which is located in `redux/store.js`**
>

```shell
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
# // Add the import below only after defining cartSlice.js. cartSlice.reducer was imported as cartReducer
# import {cartReducer} from .../cartSlice

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
  # /*cart: cartReducer*/
},
})
```
* This creates a Redux store and also automatically configures the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

**Adding React/Redux `<Provider>`**
>
Add the following to main.jsx to set up the Redux store with React-Redux's `<Provider>`
```shell
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { store } from './redux/store.js'
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  )
```
**Create a Redux State Slice for Cart in `redux/features/cart/cartSlice.js` (e.g redux/features/feature-name/feature-nameSlice.js**

```shell
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
  cartItems: []
}

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: InitialState,
  reducers: {},
})

# /* export the actions */
export const {} = cartSlice.actions; 
export default cartSlice.reducer;


```
* Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.
## Setting up [MongoDB/Mongoose]()
``` shell
npm install mongoose --save

```
**Then, set up  a connection string in `db/connect.js`  amd  assign it to MONGO_URI which should look similar to :**
```shell
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.abcd123.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

```
## Setting up [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
**ðŸ”— To see the docs, click the following [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start)**
>
**installing Firebase to your project**
``` shell
npm install firebase
```
